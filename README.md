The master branch of this project is only the starting point of the development.

Please change to 'medium-yolov8m' branch when the medium size of the YOLOv8 model wants to be used for inference and extracting the measurements (delay, consumption...) for the implementation using this model size.

Please change to 'large-yolov8m' branch when the large size of the YOLOv8 model wants to be used for inference and extracting the measurements (delay, consumption...) for the implementation using this model size.

'big-dataset' branch can be discarded. It is a test for using a larger database, but it is not the purpose of this project.
